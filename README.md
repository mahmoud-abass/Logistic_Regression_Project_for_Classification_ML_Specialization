# Logistic Regression Project

A practical **Logistic Regression** and **Regularized Logistic Regression** implementation for binary classification using Python and NumPy.

- **Part 1:** Predict student admission based on exam scores (~89% accuracy).
- **Part 2:** Classify microchip quality using polynomial features (~82% accuracy).

## Features

✅ From-scratch implementation without ML libraries.  
✅ Visualization of data and decision boundaries.  
✅ Mathematical explanation of sigmoid, cost, gradients, and regularization.
